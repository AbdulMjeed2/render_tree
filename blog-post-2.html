        <p>Planting native species is one of the most sustainable ways to green Saudi Arabia. Native trees are naturally adapted to our climate, require less water and maintenance, and support local wildlife. They also help preserve our natural heritage and create authentic landscapes that reflect the beauty of our region.</p>

        <h2>Why Choose Native Trees?</h2>
        <p>Native trees offer numerous advantages over exotic species:</p>

        <h2>Planting Guidelines</h2>
        <p>To ensure success when planting native trees, follow these guidelines:</p>

        <h3>Best Time to Plant</h3>
        <p>The ideal planting time in Saudi Arabia is during the cooler months, from October to March. This gives the trees time to establish their root systems before the hot summer months.</p>

        <h3>Site Preparation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose a location with good drainage</li>
          <li>Dig a hole twice as wide and as deep as the root ball</li>
          <li>Mix native soil with organic matter if needed</li>
          <li>Ensure the site receives adequate sunlight</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Planting Process</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Remove the tree from its container carefully</li>
          <li>Place the tree in the hole, ensuring the root collar is at ground level</li>
          <li>Backfill with soil, gently firming around the roots</li>
          <li>Create a watering basin around the tree</li>
          <li>Water thoroughly after planting</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Care and Maintenance</h2>
        <p>While native trees require less maintenance than exotic species, they still need proper care to thrive:</p>

        <h3>Watering</h3>
        <p>During the first year, water your trees regularly to help them establish. Once established, most native trees can survive with minimal watering, but they will grow better with occasional deep watering during dry periods.</p>

        <h3>Mulching</h3>
        <p>Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of your trees to help retain moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds. Keep the mulch away from the trunk to prevent rot.</p>

        <h3>Pruning</h3>
        <p>Prune your trees to remove dead or damaged branches and to maintain their shape. The best time to prune is during the dormant season or early spring.</p>

        <h2>Benefits for Your Garden</h2>
        <p>Planting native trees in your garden provides numerous benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shade:</strong> Create comfortable outdoor spaces</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Natural screens and windbreaks</li>
          <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Attract birds and beneficial insects</li>
          <li><strong>Property Value:</strong> Mature trees increase property value</li>
          <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Reduce carbon footprint and improve air quality</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Ready to plant your first native tree? Start with one of the species mentioned above, and you'll be amazed at how well they adapt to your garden. Remember, every tree you plant contributes to making Saudi Arabia greener and more beautiful.</p>
